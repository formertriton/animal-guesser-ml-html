\# ü¶Å ML Animal Guessing Game



An interactive web-based game that uses machine learning algorithms to guess animals through strategic yes/no questions. The AI learns from every game session to improve future performance.

\## Features



\- \*\*Information Gain Algorithm\*\*: Optimally selects questions to maximize learning

\- \*\*Online Learning\*\*: Improves with each game session

\- \*\*Feature Extraction\*\*: Learns animal characteristics from user descriptions

\- \*\*Confidence Scoring\*\*: Dynamic AI confidence based on remaining possibilities

\- \*\*Persistent Storage\*\*: Remembers learned animals across sessions

\- \*\*Responsive Design\*\*: Works on desktop and mobile



\## Technical Implementation



\- Vanilla JavaScript with ML algorithms

\- Information theory for question optimization

\- Local storage for data persistence

\- Feature vector representation of animals

\- Real-time confidence calculation



\## How It Works



1\. AI asks strategic yes/no questions using information gain

2\. Narrows down possibilities based on answers

3\. Makes educated guesses with confidence scoring

4\. Learns new animals when it guesses incorrectly

5\. Improves question selection for future games
